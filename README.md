# Simple Todo App

The Simple To-Do App is a user-friendly web application that helps users organize and manage tasks effectively. The project focuses on refactoring existing JavaScript code to implement Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, enhancing the modularity, scalability, and maintainability of the application. Users can create, complete, and delete tasks seamlessly with an intuitive interface.

## Functionality

The application offers the following core features:

Display a List of To-Dos:
A predefined list of to-do items is generated dynamically from JavaScript.

Add New To-Do Items:
Users can add new tasks via a popup form. The form includes validation to ensure the input is correct.

Complete or Delete To-Do Items:
Tasks can be marked as completed using checkboxes or removed entirely using a delete button.

Unique Identifiers for Tasks:
Each to-do item is assigned a unique ID using the uuid package, ensuring data consistency.

By implementing OOP, the application is modularized into reusable components, making it more efficient and easier to maintain.

## Technology

This project is built using the following technologies:

HTML: Provides the structure for the application.
CSS: Defines the styling for the user interface.
JavaScript (ES6): Implements functionality using modern practices, including OOP.
JS Modules: Ensures proper file organization and separation of concerns.
UUID Library: Generates unique IDs for each to-do item.
Live Server Extension: Facilitates running the project locally with support for JS modules.
